# Assembler
This code implements an assembler, which is a program that translates the assembly code (that contains mnemonics and operands) to a machine code (that contains only 0s and 1s).

The program consider that the input file has no syntax errors.

This assembler is made for a particular CPU with 4 registers and the particular set of instructions defined in the beginning of the code.
